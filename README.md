# Job-Portal

This is a Job Portal which I created in my internship and its made with the help of django framework in python. It uses the default sqlite3 database offered by django.

So here, the employers and employees can login remotely and contact each other through chatting. The employers can create vacancies which will be visible on the dashboard and the employees can apply for that vacancy if they possess the required skill-set. The employee can also upload their resume which the employer can observe and based on the eligibility the employer can ask for an interview. We have developed this portal in such a way that interviews can be taken directly on the website. All these employee and employer data gets automatically stored in a database which was created using the django framework.
